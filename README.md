# DemocraticRace

The Pioneer campaign mod for the (currently) Early Access game Griftlands, Democratic Race(working title) is a mod for Griftlands that adds a negotiation based campaign mode to the game, in contrast to the direct combat. Your goal in this campaign is to campaign and gain support among the people so you can be voted in as president. This story is heavily negotiation focused, and combat is only necessary if you failed certain negotiations.

## New mechanics

* A detailed Support mechanic. It determines many factors of the campaign, like your funding gained each day, the likelyhood someone will support you, and so on. It changes dynamically based on the change in relationship, as well as certain side quests or events. There are three support categories: General, Factional, and Wealth.
  * General support is the basic support stat. It can be increased by completing sidequests, making people like you, and behaving in a certain way in scenarios. You need to maintain a high support level to pass hard checks.
  * Factional support determines your support among a faction. A member liking you will increase your support among that faction, and a member disliking you will decrease your support. Running on certain campaign platforms will also influence the faction support.
  * Wealth support is similar to factional support, but is applied to wealth levels(character renown) instead of the faction. It behaves similarly to factional support, but it also determines the funding you get. Support among high wealth level will yield you more funding than support among low wealth level.
* A free time mechanic. During certain points of the story, you are granted free time. During this time, you can travel to known places and utilize them, as well as socializing with your supporters to gain a random gift, or a lead to new locations to repeat the process.
* Do whatever you can to win, the end justifies the means. That means you can drink with non-supporters to make them like you, or pay random people to shill for you.
  * Note: right now you can still provoke kill people, but it is subjected to change. Additionally, killing people won't give you support back, and you will, unsuprisingly, lose even more support among that faction.
* New "advisor" mechanic. Each advisor provides a different style of negotiation for you to buy. For example, the Diplomacy advisor guarantees to stock up 1 common Diplomacy card and 1 uncommon or above Diplomacy card. Specialize your negotiation.
* New side quests that you should not only complete, but complete well, as they will significantly determine your support level and your relationship among the people.
* More negotiations, many has their own gimmick.

## Planned Mechanics

* Once regular provoke-kills are disabled, there will be new ways to "deal" with the oppositions.
* Random events that spawns on the road.
* A support screen that displays information about support levels.
* Alliance with opposition candidates. The voting system is first past the post, so of course that's going to happen.
