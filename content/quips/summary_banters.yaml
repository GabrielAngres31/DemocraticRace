    agent:
      Feeling okay so far?
    player:
      !thought
      More or less.
    agent:
      How <i>I</> feel depends on how you do today.

    player:
      Time goes by so quickly...
      I don't think I did enough.
    agent:
      I hope you at least did what was necessary for us to win.
  - |
    player:
      !sigh
      I'm so tired from all the work I did today.
    agent:
      Hopefully that the work doesn't go to waste.

    player:
      Have you thought about why we're doing this?
      Working hard to gain support, only to bleed potential votes to our opponents, and we have to do this over and over again.
      Our support could be astronomically high, yet it might not even be enough to win.
      What's the point?
    agent:
      ...

      Have you done what I asked?
    player:
      I mean, yes.

    player:
      I hope we win.
    agent:
      So do I.
      And so does everyone else.
      But <i>will</> we win? That is the big question.

      How do you feel?
    player:
      Good, maybe?
    agent:
      I sure hope so.
      !dubious
      Judging from how badly you did yesterday, though, I'd take that with a grain of salt.

    agent:
      I hope you can do better than yesterday?
    player:
      !agree
      I hope so too.
    agent:
      !shrug
      We've got that in common.

    agent:
      Are you putting FACTS and LOGIC to good use?
    player:
      !shrug
      Probably?
      Some people don't seem to buy it, though.
    agent:
      !handwave
      Nonsense. You can't dispute FACTS and LOGIC. It goes against common sense.

    agent:
      How do you feel after your first day of politics?
    player:
      I'm a bit overwhelmed, but otherwise I'm okay.
    agent:
      That sounds good.

    agent:
      How's this lifestyle for you?
    player:
      !thought
      It's...refreshing.
      And not being in mortal danger every day is a huge plus.
      Although I don't know how I feel being in the spotlight for everything.
    agent:
      !handwave
      You'll get used to it.
    player:
      !shrug
      Maybe.
