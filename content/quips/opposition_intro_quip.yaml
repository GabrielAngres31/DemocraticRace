    As far back as I can remember, Havaria has been rife with bandits, smugglers, and widespread corruption.
    !hips
    That's why I 'm running in this election. With my leadership, we can get address these problems at their roots.
    Unfortunately, this is an election. All it takes it a few ballots to plunge Havaria deeper into dystopia.

    Havaria has had a tenuous relationship with Deltree for decades.
    This mass annexation is guaranteed to be the straw that breaks the Oshnu's shell.
    !eureka
    When I become President, I will establish Havaria's independence, once and for all.

    Look. You like money.
    I like money.
    If I get into office, I intend to let you keep more of your money...
    That's about it.
    * You don't feel like this person is suitable as a leader, but you don't have the courage to tell it to {agent.hisher} face.

    The common workers of Havaria have always been the backbone of Havarian society.
    But those born with silver spoons in their mouths have always oppressed them.
    The workers are like fuel, a powder keg of revolution and change for the better.
    I intend to be the spark.

    For years, we have watched the blessed relics of Hesh be cast aside, or treated like mere trinkets or baubles.
    No longer. Once I'm in office, I shall stop at nothing to reclaim all relics currently out of the hands of the Cardinals.
    All artifacts of Hesh will be held in their rightful reverence, unsullied by money or the greed of nonbelievers.

    I'm actually running a bit of an "independent" platform.
    The establishment plays fast and loose with contraband laws here, and that's affected my business on more than one occasion.
    I have the Jakes on my side here. If you want your goods, you'll stay out of my way.
