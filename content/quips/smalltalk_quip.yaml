      [p] Another day of toil.
      The rich just gets richer, and the poor stays poor.
    player:
      That's rough, buddy.
      You know, I plan to change that once I'm in office.
    agent:
      !happy
      Thanks.
      Glad someone considers the common folks.

    agent:
      [p] Have I told you before that I worked for this Spark Baron.
      Always rambling about wanting to be relatable to the common folks.
      His idea of "being relatable" seems way different from how everyone else thinks.
    player:
      Really? How so?
    agent:
      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him relatable.
      First off, nobody talks like that.
      Second, he isn't actually concerned with the common folks' well-being.
      He wouldn't give a second thought to giving demerits to workers who miss their quota for something that is not their fault.
    player:
      !shrug
      What can you expect from a Spark Baron, though.
    agent:
      True.
      !happy
      Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling. It has really lighten up my day.

      [p] Starting a business from the ground up is hard.
      Born to the wrong person, and you have to work ten times as hard. Often you don't even get any results.
    player:
      !shrug
      Same here to be honest. It's really hard competing against renowned members of prominent factions as a nameless grifter.
    agent:
      !agree
      Guess we are really in the same boat, huh?
    player:
      Yeah.
      Hope one day you can find your fortunes.
    agent:
      Same thing can be said to you, my friend.

    agent:
      [p] Have you heard of the tale of Tronos Anodolp?
    player:
      !thought
      Can't say I have, no.
    agent:
      He's like a small legend among us poor merchants.
      As a jarackle who owns nothing, he built up his business empire from the ground up.
    player:
      Sounds pretty impressive.
      I mean, I never dealt with the business side of things, but it seems virtually impossible for someone to make that much without a substantial starting funds.
    agent:
      !agree
      Yeah, which is precisely why he is impressive.
      I want to be as successful as him one day.
    player:
      !shrug
      Yeah... Good luck with that.
