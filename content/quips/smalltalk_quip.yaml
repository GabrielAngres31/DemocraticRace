      [p] Another day of toil.
      The rich just gets richer, and the poor stays poor.
    player:
      That's rough, buddy.
      You know, I plan to change that once I'm in office.
    agent:
      !happy
      Thanks.
      Glad someone considers the common folks.

    agent:
      [p] I work for this Spark Baron.
      Always rambling about wanting to fit in with the people.
      His idea of "fitting in" seems way different from how everyone else thinks.
    player:
      Really? How so?
    agent:
      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him fit in.
      First off, nobody talks like that.
      Second, he doesn't do anything to actually be one with the people.
      He wouldn't give a second thought to giving demerits to workers who miss their quota for something that is not their fault.
    player:
      !shrug
      What can you expect from a Spark Baron, though.
    agent:
      True.
      !happy
      Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling. It has really lighten up my day.
