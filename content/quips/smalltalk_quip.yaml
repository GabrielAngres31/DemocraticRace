      [p] Another day of toil.
      The rich just gets richer, and the poor stays poor.
    player:
      That's rough, buddy.
      You know, I plan to change that once I'm in office.
    agent:
      !happy
      Thanks.
      Glad someone considers the common folks.

    agent:
      [p] Have I told you before that I worked for this Spark Baron.
      Always rambling about wanting to be relatable to the common folks.
      His idea of "being relatable" seems way different from how everyone else thinks.
    player:
      Really? How so?
    agent:
      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him relatable.
      First off, nobody talks like that.
      Second, he isn't actually concerned with the common folks' well-being.
      He wouldn't give a second thought to giving demerits to workers who miss their quota for something that is not their fault.
    player:
      !shrug
      What can you expect from a Spark Baron, though.
    agent:
      True.
      !happy
      Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling. It has really lighten up my day.
