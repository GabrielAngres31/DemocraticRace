      Another day of toil.
      The rich get richer, and the poor stay poor.
      There really is no hope for us common folk, is there?
    player:
      I'm sorry to hear that.
      I won't let this stand if I'm elected.
      The working class will finally rise, out from under the boot of the oppressors.
    agent:
      !happy
      This is why you'll have my vote, {player}.
      Finally, someone's looking out for us.

    agent:
      There was this Spark Baron I worked for, once.
      Always rambling about wanting to be relatable to the common folk.
      But he went about it very strangely.
    player:
      Really? How so?
    agent:
      He seems to think using obscure and confusing words somehow makes him relatable.
      Nobody actually talks like that! He just made himself into more of a fool.
      Besides, he isn't actually concerned with workers' well-being.
      Even if it wasn't your fault, if you missed your quota, he got a demerit and talked over anyone who protested.
    player:
      !shrug
      That's a Spark Baron for you.
    agent:
      if that ain't the truth.
      !happy
      Anyway, thanks for listening. Feels like a weight of my chest.

      [p] Starting a business from the ground up is hard.
      Born to the wrong family, and you have to work ten times as hard. And you're not guaranteed to make it work, either.
    player:
      !shrug
      Same here, to be honest. It's hard to make a good showing against renowned members of prominent factions as a nameless grifter.
    agent:
      !agree
      Guess we are really in the same boat, huh?
    player:
      Yeah.
      Hope one day you can find your fortune.
    agent:
      And the same to you, my friend.

      [Have you heard of the tale of Gunter Trunoomiel?
    player:
      !thought
      Can't say I have, no.
    agent:
      He's like a small legend for poor merchants.
      As a jarackle who owned nothing, he built up his business empire from the ground up.
    player:
      Sounds pretty impressive.
      I mean, I never did that kind of business, but it seems virtually impossible for someone to make that much without some good money to start with.
    agent:
      !agree
      Yeah, that's why he's a legend.
      I want to be as successful as him one day.
    player:
      !shrug
      Yeah... Good luck with that.

      How hard is it to become a Priest?
    agent:
      It's difficult.
      It's extremely hard to pass the tests, to say nothing of the tithes you have to pay.
      !angry_shrug
      One of the criteria to pass is "demonstrate a strong belief in Hesh", which is...vague.
      There's this one priest who was the least devoted initiate that I've ever seen, and yet the teacher passed her!
      How is that fair?
    player:
      !shrug
      Well, different people have different way of showing devotion, I guess?
    agent:
      !sigh
      You're right.
      Hesh's will is unpredictable, and I shouldn't let my prejudice to cloud my judgement.
      I'm just a bit bitter that I need to take the test multiple times...

    agent:
      This is why we need mandatory citizenship.
      Just the other day, someone came to Admiralty Headquarters asking for some paperwork.
      His name was Al-, El-, something. It's obviously a fake name. No record of them, and we have records on pretty much everyone in Havaria.
    player:
      Uhh... What's your point?
    agent:
      The point is that there's no way for either of us to prove that he's a Havarian.
      And we have no choice but to authorize the paperwork to this possible non-citizen.
      If we have mandatory citizenship, then we can easily check, and prevent this from happening in the first place.
    player:
    {anti_independence?
      !thought
      Because if people can fake names, they can't be tracked, and then they can do Hesh-knows-what.
      That's sensible.
    agent:
      Thank you. I knew you'd have our backs.
    }
    {not anti_independence?
      !thought
      That <i>does</i> seem serious.
      I'll see what I can do about that.
    agent:
      !agree
      Of course. I knew I could count on you!

    agent:
      Ever feel like you sometimes live under your parents' shadow?
    player:
    {player_rook?
      You are talking to a retired Admiralty officer.
      I don't live under anyone's shadow.
    agent:
      That was a rhetorical question. Now, to continue with what I was saying...
    player:
      Oh, Hesh.
    }
    {player_sal or player_smith?
      If I'm being honest? Constantly.
      People have a lot of expectations for me because of who my parents are, and that feels like a lot of pressure sometimes.
    agent:
      Then you're not alone.
    }
    {not (player_rook or player_sal or player_smith)?
      Not really.
      People usually care about who I am, rather than who my parents are.
    agent:
      That's good. One less problem to deal with.
    }
    agent:
      A friend of my friend is a highly successful merchant.
      He built a business empire from the ground up, which is pretty impressive.
      !sigh
      But his son... He always felt like everyone only cared about his father's achievement, not his.
    player:
      So what happened then?
    agent:
      He wanted to be as successful as his father.
      In fact, he wanted to be the best at everything, no matter what.
      Even though that's impossible.
      That makes him insufferable, and people generally don't want to work with him.
    player:
      That seems extreme.
    agent:
      The point is, a lot of people might have huge expectations for you.
      But don't go and promise something you can't deliver on, if you don't want the same thing happening to you.

    agent:
      The Cult of Hesh is filled with a bunch of lunatics, worshipping a giant jellyfish that will probably kill everyone.
    player:
      Wow, what a conversation starter!
    {not pro_religious_policy?
      But seriously. That's a pretty big generalization - I'm sure there must be <i>some</> level-headed people in the Cult.
    }
    {pro_religious_policy?
      There's some level-headed people in the Cult, and you shouldn't underestimate them in any case.
    }
    agent:
      It's funny you should mention that.
      There's one priest who is very collected and logical.
      Probably more so than some of my colleagues.
      Which makes me wonder: Why would such a logical person join the Cult, where fanaticism is prized over reasoned consideration?
    player:
    {pro_religious_policy?
      Maybe that's not all there is to it. 
      Making generalizations like that usually means you haven't thought something through all the way.
    agent:
      Hmm. Maybe there's something more to this whole thing.
      I need to think about this a bit more.
      Thanks for the talk, by the way.
    }
    {not pro_religious_policy?
      Maybe they have an ulterior motive?
      There are plenty of reasons to join the Cult other than worship.
      Money? Power? Or something else that only the Cult can provide?
    agent:
      I think you're right.
      Hey, maybe <i>I</> should join the Cult?
    player:
      Nah. You worked with the Barons - you'll be branded a heretic if they don't kill you outright.
    agent:
      Yeah, you're right.
    }
