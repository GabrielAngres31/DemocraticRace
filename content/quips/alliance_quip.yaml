    agent:
      [p] It's been so long since we last met.
    player:
      I agree.
      My days on the derricks are certainly rough.
      But I will fight back.
    agent:
      You can. The election is your greatest chance at shaking the status quo upside down.
    player:
      Still, I am glad that I got my friend back.
    agent:
      Same.

    agent:
      [p] I guess it's back to being us two, huh?
    player:
      Just like the old times when you and I are both still in the Admiralty.
    agent:
      To be honest, I was never good at this intrigue stuff.
      I would rather beat the crap out of my enemies from the shadow than running for president.
      I guess I will leave leading people to you, Rook.
    player:
      <i>Captain</> Rook.
    agent:
      Ah, of course, Captain.
      Either way, I'm glad we can fight side by side again.
    player:
      That is based on words instead of guns.
      I guess there's a lot we can both learn.

    agent:
      [p] Perhaps you aren't as useless as I thought you would be.
    player:
      What kind of underhanded compliment was that, Vix?
    agent:
      You would rather choose to drink at bars than pursue a useful career.
      Still, seems like drinking granted you leadership abilities you can never learn at Priest Schools.
      Seems like there's a lot to learn from you, brother.
    player:
      Aw, how nice! You called me brother!
      It's as if before you didn't consider me to be your brother as if you disowned me when you got infected by some Roaloch parasite.
    agent:
      What?
    player:
      What?
