    agent:
      [p] It's been a while.
    player:
      You can say that again. I can't say I miss the derricks, though.
    agent:
      At least now you might be in a position to change things, if you win the election.
    player:
      I'm just happy to see my friend Kal again.  
    agent:
      Kal and Sal, just like it used to be. *smiles*

    agent:
      [p] And once again, it's the two of us.
    player:
      Just like old times in the Admiralty, eh?
    agent:
      There's less shooting and stabbing this time, though.
      You were always better at this political intrigue stuff, Rook, so I'll ask you to take the lead here.
    player:
      <i>Captain</> Rook.
    agent:
      Ah, of course, Captain.
      Either way, I'm glad we're fighting side by side again.
    player:
      Figuratively speaking.
    agent:
      Yes, of course.
    player:
      I guess we both still have more to learn.

    agent:
      [p] Perhaps you aren't as useless as I thought you'd be.
    player:
      An underhanded compliment? I'm flattered, Vix.
    agent:
      You remain a drunkard rather than making something of yourself.
      All the same, you seem to have gained a knack for this that you would never have found if you'd become an Initiate.
      Seems like there's a lot to learn from you, brother.
    player:
      Aw, Vix! "Brother"?
      It's as if you never disowned me after being possessed by the Roaloach!
    agent:
      What?
    player:
      What?
