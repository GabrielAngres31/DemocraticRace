    player:
      Didn't expect to see you here, {agent}.
      Why are you here?
    agent:
      The election brought more people, and more people means more business.
      What about you?
    player:
      Running for president, of course.
      Why aren't you running? The Jakes could use a leader like you.
    agent:
      Ah, of course.
      My glory days are over. Now I'm just trying to get by and get comfortable.
      Still, feel free to stay and have a drink.
