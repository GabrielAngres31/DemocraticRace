      There's a great place that I often visit.
      I'll tell you about it in case you have a spare moment to go there.
      It's called {loc_to_unlock#location}.

      Great, thanks.

      Ever enjoy an ice cold cup of plonk with a nice view of the land?
    player:
      Well... maybe?
    agent:
      Well, I know this little bar where you can find the best view in Havaria.
      Swing by the Grog n' Dog when you get the chance.
      They sell amazing drinks, and people from all over visit there, in case you need some more connections.
      You should definitely go check it out!
#I'm assuming just attaching this little thing at the end will check for the character. pardon me while I make the common smith conversation.

      Best view I've ever had was out of a large lumin pipe on a sea full of flotsam.

      Smith... Do I even need to tell you where the bar is?
    player:
      Well, no. If anything you'd be saving them the trouble of dealing with me.
      But since you proposed...
    agent:
      !sigh
      It's called {loc_to_unlock#location}. They're pretty cheap, and everyone from the Law to the Outlaws go there.
    player:
      Why thank you, my dear friend. I shall travel there at once!
    agent:
      Just don't run a tab. The bartender's a no-nonsense type, and they have powerful connections.
    player:

      No bartender's been able to deal with me yet!

      There's a bar called the Gutted Yote.
      It lies in the, ah, "lawless" part of the Bay.
      Not that the rest of the Bay is lawful. It's just...less lawful. The <i>least lawful</>, you might say.
    player:
      And you're telling me this because...?
    agent:
      If you want to make connections with the shadier side of the Bay, that's a good place to start.
      Be careful though, they'll give you harder swill if that'd mean mugging you on your way out!

    agent:
      Well, some people might not care about your diplomatic immunity.
      You never know, right?
      Anyway, check out Trusty's Outfitting. They sell all kinds of <i>equipment</>. Also hats.

      It's always a good idea to keep one or two at hand, in case push comes to shove...followed by bites and a few right hooks to the jawline.

      You should probably know where the Admiralty Headquarters is.
      Getting the Admiralty on your side is always a good thing.
    player:
      !thought
      I don't know. They're not much of a help.
      I mean, when am I ever going to use an Authorization?
      Every time I need Admiralty help, they're never around.
      Except when I have trouble <i>with</> the Admiralty, and then they're no help either.
    agent:
      !dubious
      Is that your experience with the Admiralty?
      Well, what about Sparring? Or Commander? Have they not helped in the past?
    player:

      Fair enough, then. Thanks for the location.

      It's nothing special, but you can sitll make contacts there.
      We should drink at there some time.
