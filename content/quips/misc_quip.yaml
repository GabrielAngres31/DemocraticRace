      There's a great place that I often visit.
      I should let you know.
      Just in case, you know, you want to go there during your free time.

    agent:
      Ever heard of the Grog n' Dog?
    player:
      I think I heard of it before.
    agent:
      You should definitely have heard of it, if you are Sal.
      But I don't know, 'cause I didn't bother coding to check the player character.
      Anyway, they sell amazing drinks, and people from all factions visit there.
      You should definitely go check it out!

    agent:
      There's a bar called the Gutted Yote.
      It lies in the, ah, "lawless" part of the bay.
      Not that the rest of the bay is lawful. It's just that more questionable figures visit there.
    player:
      What does that have to do with me?
    agent:
      If you want to have connections with the darker side of the bay, that's a good place to start.

    agent:
      Ever considered buying some weapons?
    player:
      I'm a politician. I use my words instead of my fists.
    agent:
      While that's true, maybe consider stocking up on self-defense equipment.
      You never know, right?
      Anyway, check out Trusty's Outfitting. They sell all kinds of equipment.

    agent:
      If you get hurt, you should definitely visit the Better Living Chemist.
      They will sell you different types of chemicals and healing items.
      It's always a good idea to keep one or two at hand.

      You should probably know where the Admiralty Headquarters is.
      Getting the Admiralty on your good side is always a good thing.
    player:
      !thought
      I don't know. Their boons are kind of useless.
      I mean, when am I ever going to use Authroization?
      Every time I need Admiralty help, they are never there.
      And when I run into trouble with the Admiralty, I can't even use it.
    agent:
      !dubious
      Is that your experience with the Admiralty?
      Well, you should try again this time. I promise your experience will be different.
    player:
      !shrug
      If you say so.
