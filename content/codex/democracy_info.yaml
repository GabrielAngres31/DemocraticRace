    The Lower Class is at the bottom of Havarian hierarchy. They live in poverty, has to worry about their next meal constantly, and have no hope of improving their living conditions. They are often manual laborers or goons for the more powerful entities. Most of the people in Havaria belong in this class. They have no say in high level politics, but due to the sheer number of them, it's important as a politician to keep them happy.

    The Middle Class is slightly more well off than the Lower Class, though not by much. They don't have to worry about their next meal, but they can easily fall to the Lower Class if they are not careful. They may have some power over the Lower Class, and they may own properties or shops, but they have little say in high level politics. Keeping this group happy can grants you much support among the people.
