    The Lower Class is at the bottom of the totem hole, looking up at the totem pole. They live in poverty and have no hope of improving their living conditions - even their next meal isn't guaranteed. They are often manual laborers, or occasionally goons for higher-class citizens. Most of the people in Havaria belong to this class. They have no real say in high level politics, but are politically significant due to their sheer numbers.

    The Middle Class is better well off than the Lower Class, though not by much - they're still one bad day or emergency from falling to the bottom. They can own properties and shops, and contract lower-class workers, but they have little influence in high-level politics. Most real popular support comes from this class.

upper_class:

  trigger: Upper Class|upper class
  body: |
    The Upper Class is comprised of citizens who make large profits for themselves, often through questionably legal enterprises. They make in a day what a laborer makes in a month. With a ubiquitous, though minor, influence in the goings-on of Havaria, this group represents an opportunity to garner good funds and good favors.

    The Elite Class are the pinnacle of Havarian society - lots of assets as well as significant power and influence. If anything important happens in Havaria, chances are they know about it, especially considering their faction connections. What they lack in numbers for voting power, they make up for in an unparalleled ability to have their will done, through money or favors. Even one connection in this group is a boon for any politician.

    A few weeks ago, the major factions decided to stop fighting for power with force, opting for a more diplomatic approach. It's unclear how all the factions were made to truce at the same time. As part of the Truce Deal, a democratic election to decide a President was started, and will conclude within the week.

    The system used for the Democratic Race in Havaria. Each voter has one vote to choose their favorite candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins. (Note: Should properly be, "Plurality Voting", or possibly "Majoritarian Voting")

    In a First Past The Post system, it is pointless to vote for a candidate that you know isn't going to win. As such, a person can vote strategically, and choose the person that is most likely to win rather than the person that most aligns with their ideology.

    A diner that is owned by Wendy and her sister, Abigail. People call it Wendy's because nobody has ever seen Abigail, but Wendy doesn't like that.
